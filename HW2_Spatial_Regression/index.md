## Overview

This analysis examines spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression models applied to Philadelphia block group housing data. The study includes:

- **Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis**: Global and Local Moran's I statistics to detect clustering patterns in median home values
- **OLS Regression**: Baseline ordinary least squares model with diagnostics for heteroscedasticity and residual autocorrelation
- **Spatial Lag Model**: Accounting for spatial dependence via spatially lagged dependent variable
