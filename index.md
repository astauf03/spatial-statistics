# Welcome to the MUSA 5000 Portfolio

This portfolio showcases the four main homework assignments from the MUSA program's Spatial Stats class taught by Eugene Brusilovskiy. 

## About This Course

It covers skills needed to analyze urban data and perform common spatial analyses that draw on traditional statistics, spatial econometrics, and machine learning. 

Specific components include: 1. regression analysis (OLS, ridge/lasso, logistic, multinomial logit); 2. measures of spatial autocorrelation; 3. spatial regression (spatial lag, spatial error, geographically weighted regression); 4. point pattern analysis; 5. an introduction to clustering methods (k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN); and 6. big data and GIS.

## Portfolio Structure
- **Weekly Notes:** learning reflections and key concepts
- **Labs:** completed assignments and analyses
- **Final Project:** capstone modeling challenge
