# Welcome to the MUSA 5000 Portfolio

This portfolio showcases the four main homework assignments from the MUSA program's Spatial Stats class taught by Eugene Brusilovskiy. 

## About This Course

It covers skills needed to analyze urban data and perform common spatial analyses that draw on traditional statistics, spatial econometrics, and machine learning. 

Specific components include: 1. regression analysis (OLS, ridge/lasso, logistic, multinomial logit); 2. measures of spatial autocorrelation; 3. spatial regression (spatial lag, spatial error, geographically weighted regression); 4. point pattern analysis; 5. an introduction to clustering methods (k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN); and 6. big data and GIS.

The actual code sources contain incomplete descriptive analyses, but the ones I could render will be featured on the website.

## About Me

My name is Alexandra Stauffer, I am a graduate student in the Urban Spatial Analytics program with the University of Pennsylvania. Alongside my background in anthropology, I am interested in public service through the spatial lens. I currently am a data intern for the City of Philadelphia's Managing Director's Office - Health and Human Services.  

These homework assignments were done in collaboration with **Jun Luu** and **Tess Vu**, their githubs will be linked below.
